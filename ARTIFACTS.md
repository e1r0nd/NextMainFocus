I want to see only the current task for each project on the Home Page.<br>
Home Page could be configured.

**List of projects.**
* Projects are displayed in a list ordered by index.
* The order of projects cannot be changed.
* The list can be filtered by the phrase.
* The project can be viewed in details so the list of its tasks is displayed

**Lists of tasks.**
* Tasks are displayed in a list ordered by order, grouped by project.
* The list can be filtered by the phrase.
* The order of projects cannot be changed in this view.
* The tasks could be moved to another project.

**Properties.**
* The project/task can be added, inputs: title, state.
* The project/task can be deleted.
* Projects/Tasks can be an unlimited number.
* The tasks' order could be changed.
